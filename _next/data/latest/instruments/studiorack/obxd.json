{"pageProps":{"plugin":{"author":"discoDSP","homepage":"https://github.com/reales/OB-Xd","name":"OB-Xd","description":"Based on the Oberheim OB-X. It attempts to recreate its sound and behaviours, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design. The OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound.","tags":["Instrument","Synth","OB-X"],"date":"2021-05-30T08:00:00.000Z","files":{"linux":{"name":"obxd-linux.zip","size":21745339,"url":"https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/releases/download/v2.4.0/obxd-linux.zip"},"win":{"name":"obxd-win.zip","size":20368962,"url":"https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/releases/download/v2.4.0/obxd-win.zip"},"mac":{"name":"obxd-mac.zip","size":6653931,"url":"https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/releases/download/v2.4.0/obxd-mac.zip"},"audio":{"name":"obxd.flac","size":63794,"url":"https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/releases/download/v2.4.0/obxd.flac"},"image":{"name":"obxd.jpg","size":76569,"url":"https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/releases/download/v2.4.0/obxd.jpg"}},"license":"gpl-3.0","id":"studiorack/obxd","version":"2.4.0"}},"__N_SSG":true}
