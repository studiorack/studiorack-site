It can also be used as an effect. Unlike the name, most of metallic texture comes from Schroeder allpass section rather than FDN (feedback delay network). FDN section makes nice impact sound when `FDN.Time` is short. Tremolo is added to simulate wobbling of cymbal.","id":"f-d-n-cymbal","files":{"audio":{"name":"FDNCymbal.flac","size":1546996},"image":{"name":"FDNCymbal.png","size":45637},"linux":{"name":"FDNCymbal_0.2.14.zip","size":2705642},"win":{"name":"FDNCymbal_0.2.14.zip","size":2705642},"mac":{"name":"FDNCymbal_0.2.14.zip","size":2705642}},"release":"UhhyouPlugins0.50.0","repo":"ryukau/vstplugins","license":{"key":"gpl-3.0","name":"GNU General Public License v3.0","url":"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0","same":true}}},"__N_SSG":true}
